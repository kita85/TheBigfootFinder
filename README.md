# TheBigfootFinder
## Bigfoot Sighting Analysis
This application computes the probability that you will encounter a bigfoot at a particular lat / lng. The 
sighting data used to generate the map and charts are real, however the probability calculation is up for debate.
It is calculated by doing some arbitrary math with random chance (chances of winning the lottery), proximity, and 
area sightings. Charts and tables are provided to help aid your search and determine optimal season, moon phase, 
and so forth. If you encounter a bigfoot by using this application. I cannot accept responsibility for potential
injury. Please use at your own risk.


This code engine can easily be adapted to other data sets. For example, adding real estate data, you could create
a heat map for "No Vacancy" properties in a particular area. Thus discovering the optimal locations to
purchase a vacation rental.
